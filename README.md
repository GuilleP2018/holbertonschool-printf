:computer: In this project we made our own printf() function

Its called _printf() and is more simple that the original C library function. Our function sends formatted output to stdout but dont accept the following format tags: flags, width, .precision and length.

### 📁 ON PJ :

- man_3_printf - man page for function created
- _printf.c - file that contains the function that produces output according to a format
- main.h - file that contains the prototypes used on this project.
- conv_spec.c - file that containts all the functions with the formats specifier
### What is format specifier?

A format specifier in c are used to take input and print the output of a type. The symbol we use in every format specifier is %. The specifier tells the compiler about the type of data that most be given or input and the type of data that most be printed on the screen.

| Format Specifier | Used for...                                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| %%               | Write a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.  |
| %i, %d           | Write a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line. |
| %s               | Write a function that prints strings, followed by a new line. |
| %c               | Write a function that prints anything.                        |

### Challenges:

Challenges Faced:

- Implementing Conversion Functions for Each Format Specifier
- Error Handiling (dealing with invalid format specifier, ect..)
- Ensuring Code Efficiency
