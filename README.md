# HOLBERTONSCHOOL-PRINTF :)

### ᴡʜᴀᴛ ɪꜱ ᴛʜɪꜱ ᴘʀᴏᴊᴇᴄᴛ ᴀʙᴏᴜᴛ??

:computer: In this project we made our own printf() function

Its called _printf() and is more simple that the original C library function. Our function sends formatted output to stdout but dont accept the following format tags: flags, width, .precision and length.

### FILES ON PJ
